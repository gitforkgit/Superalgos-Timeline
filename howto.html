        This page is a how to, so everybody can feed this timeline/-s with Information. Just fork the repository and copy a related paragraph and insert the date(possibly acu time) and the information. First choose a meaningful headline and then a short text explaining the information.
    </p>
    <p class="timeline-type">
        IMPORTANT: At this point change the boxes from left to right, depending on the side the last box was on. Later on the sides could get meaning like: left side=important, right side=informative.Fell free to implement things like that or anything else as this project is meant to be for the community.
    </p>
    <p class="timeline-type">
      It is also possible that a "future" timeline could get implemneted showing what the tasks for Today/the week/the month/the year... is. Differentiating what instantly needs to get fixed, and what wishes are.
  </p>
  <p class="timeline-type">
    Another Idea maybe coloring the dates and boxes in colors reagrding months or different weeks to instantly get an Overview as well as hourly, where the color of the week is very bright for early hours in the day and gets darker until the end of the day, but that is stuff that would need to get coded.

  For the syntax, just copy one of the two elements(left timeline Box or right timeline Box) and insert your text there, fill it in the code and make a pull request
